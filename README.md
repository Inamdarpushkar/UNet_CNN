# UNet CNN
# UNet model to segment building coverage in Boston using Remote sensing data

I implemented the UNet Convolutional Neural Network architecture for segmenting the building
footprints from the image. Here I aimed at classifying each pixel representing building footprints.
It is important to note that I specifically focused on the buildings and did not consider any other
features like roads, bridges, etc. I used high resolution aerial image provided by the USGS.
